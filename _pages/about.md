For centuries, seafarers have developed an intuitive relationship with their vessels, reading the wind and feeling a ship’s movementthrough embodied engagement. However, as maritime systems become more automated, this connection shifts toward abstract, screen-based controls.In a collaborative workshop, participants will prototype interaction ideas that balance automation and human control through simulated maritime tasks. They will develop tactile and multimodal interface concepts and test their effectiveness in a maritime
simulator to enhance situational awareness and decision-making in dynamic environments.

The workshop’s three key outcomes are: (1) **Insights into Tactile Interfaces** Participants will explore physical controls and their importance in safety-critical tasks. (2) **Simulation  Based Evaluation** The workshop will explore the use of simulation as an evaluation method for tactile interface designs, providing a means of comparison between prototypes. (3) **Research Community Development** It will foster collaboration among researchers beyond the workshop by creating communication channels such as Discord.
