Join us for an exciting workshop that delves into the dynamic world of interaction design for automation through an engaging hands-on simulation! Participants are invited to bring their physical prototypes or share innovative conceptual ideas about interaction, control, and evaluation. Our collaborative simulation environment promises to spark vibrant discussions and inspire fresh approaches to designing and evaluating interfaces. We welcome contributions from diverse fields, including Haptics, Digital Fabrication, Human-Robot Interaction, Interface Design, and Simulation Research.

To apply, you can either:
* Fill out our interest form to share your ideas and questions about  physical interfaces and simulation evaluation, or
* Submit in the DIS22 Pictorial format detailing a prototype, interaction concept, or evaluation scenario you would want to contribute.

Participants will have 5-10 minutes to present their work during the workshop. Submissions will be reviewed for relevance and contribution to the workshop goals.
